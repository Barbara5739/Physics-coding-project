# Sun
## DISCLAIMER:
Since the main code is still undergoing updates, code in this branch is used exclusively to save previous versions of specific parts of the sun class to refer back to if necessary. It is not necessary for running the main code.

This object doesn't move. It represents the Sun in the plot, and the planets orbit around it.
