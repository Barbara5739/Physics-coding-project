# Planets

## DISCLAIMER:
Since the main code is still undergoing updates, code in this branch is used exclusively to save previous versions of specific parts of the planet class to refer back to if necessary. It is not necessary for running the main code.

Planets have elliptical orbits around the Sun. These are calculated using Newton's law of gravitation F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2
