# Aliens
## DISCLAIMER:
Since the main code is still undergoing updates, code in this branch is used exclusively to save previous versions of specific parts of the alien class to refer back to if necessary. It is not necessary for running the main code.

'Alien visitor' creates an object that follows a parabolic path. Representing a comet, an asteroid, or actually an alien, it does not stay in the plot.
