# Moons

## DISCLAIMER:
Since the main code is still undergoing updates, code in this branch is used exclusively to save previous versions of specific parts of the moon class to refer back to if necessary. It is not necessary for running the main code.

Moons are objects that orbit planets. Plotting at least one planet is necessary for plotting them.
