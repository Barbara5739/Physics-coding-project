# Star system visualization

This code plots a visualization of a star system with various objects.

The code allows users to visualize a simplified star system. Planet, moon and and alien objects are created and their paths are visualized. The motion of the various objects is calculated using both simpler mathematical equations and, in some cases, equations that simulate the forces in a similar way to a real star system. Planets move on a circular orbit around the central star, while moons move on circular orbits around planets. The 'alien' objects represent comets or asteroids that follow parabolic orbits. Anyone interested in coding plots that move, or interested in visualizing various star systems could find this code useful. 


## Features

class -- sun: 
An object representing the star. It is stationary, and it should always be plotted as some of the orbits are calculated in a purely mathematical manner, and will behave as if the star were there, even if the code is modified to remove it.

class -- planet:
Object(s) orbiting the sun. The shape of the orbit is circular. Experiment with the code: can you plot more than one planet? Two planets on the same orbit (like Earth and Theia)? Orbits with various radii?

class -- moon:
Object(s) orbiting planets. They, too, have a circular orbit. Plotting them requires plotting at least one planet.

class -- alien:
This object follows a parabolic orbit. It enters the plot, then leaves; it does not stay in the simulated star system. This could represent an asteroid, a comet or even a green extraterrestrial looking around!
