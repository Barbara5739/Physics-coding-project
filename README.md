# Star system visualization

This code plots a visualization of a star system with various objects.

The code allows users to visualize a simplified star system. Planet, moon and and alien objects are created and their paths are visualized. The motion of the various objects is calculated using both simpler mathematical equations and, in some cases, equations that simulate the forces in a similar way to a real star system. Planets move on a circular orbit around the central star, while moons move on circular orbits around planets. The 'alien' objects represent comets or asteroids that follow parabolic orbits. Anyone interested in coding plots that move, or interested in visualizing various star systems could find this code useful. 


Features:

class -- sun: 
An object representing the star. It is stationary, and it is always plotted.

class -- planet:
Object(s) orbiting the sun. The shape of the orbit is circular.
